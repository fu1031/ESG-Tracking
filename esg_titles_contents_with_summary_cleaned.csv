Supplier blind spots that could cost you: CSCO priorities for 2025,"N-tier suppliers are quickly emerging as one of the highest-risk areas in global supply chains, according to findings from Sphera’s 2025 Supply Chain Risk Report,

The report, which reviews data from 2024, found that force majeure declarations rose by 61%, hazardous materials alerts increased 54%, and quality issues jumped 22% — all within a single year.

A critical insight is emerging: Most supply chain disruptions do not originate from Tier 1 suppliers. Instead, they stem from N-tier suppliers, those operating deeper within the supply chain. Research shows that approximately 85% of significant supply chain incidents can be traced back to Tier 2-4 suppliers. However, limited visibility into these tiers often prevents companies from identifying risks until disruption has already occurred.

What’s driving this lack of visibility? And how can organizations address the accountability and transparency challenges associated with Tier N suppliers?

This article explores:

Key sources of hidden risk beyond Tier 1

How siloed systems contribute to operational blind spots","The article reveals that N-tier suppliers (Tier 2-4) are a growing concern and source of risk in supply chains, as disruptions often come from these levels. 

It suggests that organizations can address this issue by prioritizing collaboration and transparency, breaking down information silos, and enhancing visibility into suppliers below Tier 1 to improve risk identification and mitigation measures.",https://sphera.com/resources/blog/supplier-blind-spots-that-could-cost-you-csco-priorities-for-2025/
What enterprise leaders are prioritizing after a decade of disruption,"The last decade has delivered some of the most disruptive supply chain catastrophes in modern history. From factory shutdowns and forced labor scandals to geopolitical trade shifts and supplier collapses, these events have reshaped how procurement and supply chain leaders define and prioritize risk.

The Sphera 2025 Supply Chain Risk Report reveals the extent of challenges suppliers faced in 2024, with bankruptcy declarations surging by 48%, force majeure declarations jumping 61% and ESG-related risk indicators rising 6% during the same period.

This post explores how a decade of disruption has transformed the playbook for how enterprise leaders approach risk frameworks, investment decisions and supplier accountability.","The article explains that the last decade has been marked by supply chain disruptions, from pandemic closures to forced labor issues. It reveals insights into the particular areas of focus that will help companies adapt to these challenges, such as risk frameworks, investment decisions, and supplier accountability that prioritize sustainability and reliable suppliers.",https://sphera.com/resources/blog/what-enterprise-leaders-are-prioritizing-after-a-decade-of-disruption/
NOAA Ocean Acidification Program,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) aims to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and store it long-term underground or in the ocean. There are many techniques and strategies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, some of which operate on land whereas others are in the ocean. Ocean-based methods are often referred to as marine CDR (mCDR). These techniques differ in their readiness for deployment and there are many unknowns about scalability, effectiveness, cost, and social and ecological impacts.

NOAA’s CDR Research Strategy presents the benefits and risks of different land-based and ocean-based techniques and NOAA assets available to assess them.","The key insights from the article are:

Quantifying supply chain decarbonization as a pillar for becoming a net-zero company,"Overview

With the Ambition 2039, Mercedes-Benz committed themselves to become a carbon-neutral* company by 2039 along their entire value chain. Hence Mercedes-Benz is not only taking responsibility for emissions that occur when using their vehicles, but also for emissions that occur when producing the vehicle. A huge proportion of these emissions do not occur at Mercedes-Benz locations, but in its supply chain. To develop a realistic yet ambitious decarbonization strategy, gaining transparency about emissions hotspots in the supply chain and quantifying potential reduction measures is crucial. Mercedes-Benz, therefore, decided to partner with Sphera’s Sustainability Consultants, leveraging their detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) models and supply chain expertise to address this need.

*include all greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol that are converted in CO2-equivelents

IN THIS CASE STUDY","The Mercedes-Benz company has committed to achieving a carbon-neutral status by 2039 and has partnered with the sustainability consultants Sphera to help them reach this goal.

"A message from Paul Marushka, CReporting with Purpose: The Business Case for Scope 3 Resiliency","It’s hard to believe we’re already nearing the midpoint of 2025, and it’s been an eventful start to the year in the world of sustainability.

Yet, companies continue to focus on sustainability risk as an important area of focus. According to the latest findings from Sphera’s new 2025 Scope 3 Report, a majority (87%) of respondents that report on emissions do so voluntarily with a growing number including Scope 3 in their disclosures as part of an overall sustainability risk identification and mitigation effort.

These organizations recognize the strategic, reputational and operational value of managing their carbon footprint through sustainability. In other words, for them, Scope 3 disclosure is important, for reasons beyond basic regulatory compliance.

Scope 3 emissions—the indirect emissions generated across a company’s entire value chain, from upstream suppliers to downstream product use—can account for as much as 75% of a company’s total carbon footprint. Accurately assessing and reducing these emissions is not just essential for achieving net-zero goals, it’s foundational for understanding and managing business risk.

Scope 3 reporting on the rise

The 2025 Scope 3 Report makes one thing clear: forward-thinking organizations aren’t disclosing Scope 3 emissions simply to meet regulatory demands—they’re doing it to gain a competitive edge through transparency, accountability and long-term value creation. Of the companies disclosing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, 79% now report on Scopes 1, 2 and 3—up from 52% in 2024. And nearly 73% of businesses that don’t yet report on Scope 3 intend to do so soon.

Realizing the Scope 3 advantage

At its core, Scope 3 disclosure unlocks significant business value—enabling companies to leverage high-quality data, implement scalable reporting frameworks, and confidently meet both current and future regulatory demands. More importantly, value chain transparency strengthens supplier relationships, enhances operational resilience, and builds trust with investors and stakeholders—each a cornerstone of long-term, sustainable success. Organizations that view Scope 3 reporting as a strategic advantage rather than a compliance burden are transforming complexity into opportunity—and in doing so, they’re not just keeping pace with change, they’re leading it.","The article highlights that companies are voluntarily reporting their emissions, focusing on sustainability risk, as it's seen as strategic, reputational, and operationally valuable. It's also shows that organizations recognize the importance of Scope 3 emissions beyond regulatory demands, as it helps create a competitive edge through transparency, accountability, and long-term value creation.",https://sphera.com/resources/ceo-letter/reporting-with-purpose-the-business-case-for-scope-3-resiliency/

DeBriefed 30 May 2025: Earth eyes 2C; Why net-zero is not behind UK bill hikes; US academics stage climate science ‘fire hose’,"Welcome to Carbon Brief’s DeBriefed.

An essential guide to the week’s key developments relating to climate change.

This week

Earth eyes 2C

TEMPERATURE WARMING: Global temperatures could hit nearly 2C above pre-industrial levels for the first time in the next five years, according to new data from the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) covered by the Financial Times. The outlet noted that this would not represent a breach of the Paris Agreement target of keeping warming below 2C, as this threshold is typically measured over at least two decades. However, it added that 2C of warming would result in a “fall in crop yields” and more than a third of the world’s population being exposed to extreme heat.

WILDFIRE EMERGENCY: Wildfires in Canada have forced thousands of people to flee their homes, CBC News reported. The government of Manitoba declared a state of emergency after evacuating 17,000 people and neighbouring province Saskatchewan followed suit a day later, CBC News said. Manitoba premier Wab Kinew said the prevalence of fire in “every region” was a “sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to”, according to Le Monde. BBC News noted that “scientists have linked worsening wildfire seasons to climate change”.

MONSOON IN MAY: Monsoon rains hit the coast of India’s southernmost state of Kerala eight days early, marking the earliest arrival of the rainy season in 16 years, Reuters reported. Just two days later, the rains reached Mumbai – the city’s earliest monsoon in 75 years, according to Business Standard. India Today said human-caused climate change and “natural climatic systems” played a role.

ALPINE DISASTER: A landslide of ice, mud and rocks triggered by the collapse of a glacier has buried a large part of the Swiss village of Blatten, Swissinfo reported. Climate scientist Christian Huggel told Reuters that climate change had “likely played a part in the deluge”, given that the loss of permafrost can “negatively affect the stability of mountain rock”. The Swiss army has been deployed to find a missing person, Reuters said.

Around the world

INDONESIA UN-QUITS COAL: Indonesia set out plans to build new coal plants in its power supply plan for 2025-2034, “backtrack[ing]” on its previous pledge to gradually phase out coal assets, the Straits Times said.

Latest climate research

Researchers in Nature Climate Change looked at how floods drove migration between counties in the US from 2006-19, finding young, educated people were more likely to leave following a disaster, while older, unemployed people were more likely to move into an affected area.

Sea ice strength and “pressure” along two major Arctic shipping routes will decline “substantially” over the next two decades under strong warming, according to findings in Geophysical Research Letters.

A study in Nature revealed that changes to concentrations of air pollutants have contributed in recent decades to an increase in the global “methane sink”, the amount of methane that is removed from the atmosphere and thus unable to drive up temperatures.

Captured

A new analysis by Carbon Brief of data from UK energy regulator Ofgem showed how the biggest driver of recent increases in electricity bills in the UK has been wholesale electricity prices – which in the UK are set almost exclusively by wholesale gas prices. In contrast, “green levies” – costs added to bills in order to pay for government climate policies – actually fell during the height of the gas price spike, as the dark grey area of the chart shows. This runs counter to opposition politicians’ claims that the UK’s high electricity prices are caused by its target for net-zero emissions by 2050 and green levies.

Spotlight

Livestreaming for climate science

This week, Carbon Brief speaks to US climate scientists taking part in a 100-hour livestream aimed at raising awareness of their work and the risks they face.

Marathon livestreams are typically the preserve of video gamers, sex workers and chess stars – not climate scientists. But unusual times call for unusual measures.

Hundreds of climate scientists and meteorologists from across the US are this week participating in a 100-hour livestream, which aims to raise awareness of their work as the government gears up for a major programme of cuts to federal science agencies.

The broadcast runs day and night until Sunday afternoon on YouTube, with each speaker advised to dedicate their 30-45 minute session to presenting their research in layperson’s terms – with a mention of how it is or could be impacted by federal cuts to science.

The online event comes after the Trump administration set out plans to halve NASA’s science budget and shrink the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA’s) funding by more than a quarter.

The livestream will be rolling while NASA’s climate and space monitoring lab, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, is moving out of its New York building on 31 May, after the federal government abruptly terminated the space agency’s lease.

(The White House has also cancelled funding to the body that produces the country’s National Climate Assessment, blocked US scientists from attending Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change meetings and laid off hundreds of workers at the agency responsible for hurricane preparations.)

Speaking to Carbon Brief in a personal capacity, climate scientist and keynote speaker Dr Kate Marvel described the livestream event as a “fire hose of public engagement”. She added:

“It is scientists making the case to the people we work for. We work for the American people because we receive taxpayer dollars. It is really important for us to share our results, to explain to people why what we do is important and to help them see themselves in what we do.”

‘Climate science affects us all’

At 1:30am California time – 4:30am New York time – on Thursday morning, more than 750 people were tuned in to the livestream, and the comment section was lively.

Some viewers shared words of encouragement – “not from the continent of America but still here to support!!! climate science affects us all!!!!” and “beautiful visualisations!”

Others focused on the science: “Look up the relationship between the Salton Sea and earthquakes – fascinating findings”, “does this mean misaligned storms have two different impacts on each level?” and “albedo effect [fire emoji]”.

Livestream organiser Dr Margaret Duffy, who studies cloud dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the event’s “long format” is designed to underscore the “widespread” nature of the cuts. She told Carbon Brief:

“[It will] make clear that it’s not one or two programmes that are being cut, [nor] one or two researchers that are losing their funding. Researcher after researcher after researcher will explain what they do, and then make the connection to the cuts and what is happening to them.”

The audience is being pointed to materials to help them contact their political representatives about cuts to climate and weather research – but this is not an obligation, Duffy said, explaining that “at a very basic level, we just want to share with the public what it is that we do”.

Climate scientist Marvel commended the livestream organisers for “stepping up” amid much-justified “flailing” and “panic”, adding:

“We are not in normal times. There is a lot of fear and there’s a lot of reasons to be afraid. I think trouble may be coming for us – but we just need to make sure that we get in good trouble. [In other words] you shake things up, you maybe attract negative attention. Maybe it’s scary and maybe there are consequences. But ultimately, you are always going to be happy to have done the right thing.”

Why does the map show experts from global north countries?

All experts on the database are nationals of at least one global south country. However, some experts have dual nationality, and are affiliated with both a global north and a global south country. Experts with dual nationality are shown twice on the map.

Is there any way of knowing who will be a good speaker? Could you rate people?

The database includes a section for experts to list their media experience. This will allow journalists to see who has experience, and look at past media appearances to make your own judgement.

Why must experts submit their own details? This is putting the burden of responsibility back onto the global south.

Self-submission means that only people interested in being contacted by the media are included in the database. It also limits any biases that might arise from the Global South Climate Database team selecting experts for the database.

Experts must also submit their own details to the database for data protection reasons. This ensures that everyone on the database has given permission for their personal data to be shared publicly. To keep this extra work to a minimum, the form is very quick to fill in.

I’m not a global south expert, how can I get involved?

You can help promote the call for submissions, and spread the word to journalists about the database by using our social media toolkit: https://bit.ly/GSCD-Tooklit.

Who manages the database?

Guest post: How climate change is fuelling record-breaking extreme weather,"Recent years have seen a rapid succession of climate-related records broken.

To name just a few, the world has witnessed record warmth in the Atlantic, unprecedented glacier melt, all-time low Antarctic sea ice extent, the Amazon’s worst drought since observations began and UK temperatures soaring past 40C for the first time.

In a review article, published in Nature Reviews Earth & Environment, my coauthors and I look at how the frequency of weather records is changing as the planet warms.

We find that the number of hot temperature records observed around the world since 1950 far exceed what would be expected in a million years in a world without human-caused climate change.

Specifically, we show that “all-time” daily hot records on land were more than four times higher in 2016-24 than they would have been in a world without climate change.

Meanwhile, daily maximum rainfall records were up 40% over the same time period and record cold events were twice as rare.

A key finding of our research is that it is the pace of global warming that controls the occurrence of records.

We show that, if the pace of warming were to slow down, the frequency of record-breaking hot events would start to decline – even if global temperatures continue to rise.

Counting records

By definition, records are supposed to be rare events, at least in a system that is not changing.

Statistics of record occurrence are remarkably simple. They are expected to become rarer the longer a measurement series gets.

The chance of observing a new record after 20 years of measurement is one in 20, or 5%. And after 100 years of observations, the chances of a new record drops to 1%.

For example, this is why it becomes increasingly difficult to break records in athletics as time goes by, unless training methods or sports equipment improve.

Record-breaking weather events – for example, the highest windspeed, most intense rainfall or hot and cold temperatures – also face these odds in a climate that is “stationary”.

However, today’s climate is not stationary, but warming at a very high pace. This has significant implications for the record count.

The plot below shows how the frequency of all-time hot records (dashed red line) and record cold events (dashed blue line) has changed since the 1960s. This is compared to the probability that would be expected under a stationary climate (black line).

(The plot uses ERA5, a reanalysis dataset, which combines observations and models from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).)

It illustrates how the frequency of hot events declined more slowly than would be expected in a stationary climate since 1950, before increasing in the last 15 years. Meanwhile, the frequency of record cold events is declining more quickly than expected.

This is contrasted with the theoretical probability of new records expected in a stationary climate as the temperature measurement series expands (black line). Credit: Amended from Fischer et al (2025).

The record ratio

Tracking the ratio between the measured number of records and the one theoretically expected in a stationary climate – the “record ratio” – reveals the fingerprint of climate change.

Analysis of ERA5 data and Berkeley Earth surface temperature observations finds that the record ratio over the last decade for hot records over global land regions is more than four. For cold records, it is between 0.2 and 0.5, showing that record-breaking cold has declined

In other words, there were more than four times as many hot record events and less than half as many cold record events than would be expected without global warming.

In 2023 and 2024, the record ratio for hot events reached 5.5 and 6.2, respectively.

Record ratios tend to be higher over global oceans than on land. They are also higher for monthly or seasonal record temperatures than all-time daily records.

This is because natural variability in the climate tends to be smaller over oceans and for longer averaging periods, such as months and seasons.

Record counts directly relate to the relationship between rates of warming and natural fluctuations in the climate. This is sometimes referred to as the “signal-to-noise ratio”. (The “signal” being the long-term trend of climate change and “noise” referring to short-term fluctuations of natural variability.)

As a result, event types and regions with a higher signal-to-noise ratio tend to see a greater number of records.

Another way of illustrating the signal of climate change is by counting the total number of records in a measurement series.

In a stationary climate, there should be about five records in 100 years of temperature measurements, 7.5 in 1,000 years and less than 10 in 10,000 years.

However, our analysis of records in two measurement series shows how the number of record-breaking events has become significantly higher as the climate has changed.

For example, as the figure on the left below illustrates, a new annual record for average global temperature has been set 25 times over the past 175 years.

Meanwhile, the figure on the right shows how, in the Pacific north-west, a new five-day average heat record has been set 14 times within the last 75 years. The spike in temperature in 2021 reflects the brutal heatwave that killed hundreds of people and brought devastating wildfires that almost entirely destroyed the Canadian village of Lytton.

(In both figures, the warm records are marked by pink circles.)

According to fundamental laws of statistics, 14 new records would not be expected in more than a million years in a climate that is not warming.

Twenty-five warm records are marked by pink circles. Right: Annual five-day maxima of average temperature in the Pacific north-west, based on ERA5 reanalysis, along with 14 heat records marked by pink circles. Credit: Erich Fischer.

It is worth noting that some climate variables, including ocean heat content, sea level rise and minimum glacier or ice sheet volumes, are changing so relentlessly that new record levels are currently set every year.

Record-shattering events

Record-shattering events are a subset of record-breaking events whose magnitude exceeds the previous event by a large margin.

In our research, we define this as more than one standard deviation, which is a measure of how spread out data is from the average.

(The exact value of standard deviation varies for different parts of the world. For example, when it comes to year-to-year average temperatures, one standard deviation is typically 2-3C in the Arctic, but less than 0.5C over the ocean).

These events of unprecedented intensity are often very impactful as they strongly exceed the conditions that society or ecosystems have experienced in the past.

The 2021 heatwave in the Pacific north-west, mentioned above, is a forbidding example.

Our research finds that the large number of record-shattering events in the past three decades is the consequence of a very high warming rate.

Using a simple timeseries model, we illustrate why the pace of warming is the key factor explaining the occurrence of record-shattering events.

In the left-hand figure, we assume a 150-year period of no warming followed by some linear warming at three different rates, which is a very simplistic approximation of historical and future warming pathways.

The right-hand figure illustrates what happens to the probability of record-shattering events in the Pacific north-west region under these three simplified pathways. It shows that the probability of record-shattering events at first rapidly increases and then stabilises. And the level at which the probability stabilises is greater the higher the rate of warming.

Left: Three illustrative warming pathways with +/- 20% differing warming rates from a timeseries model. Right: Annual probability of record-shattering events (at or beyond one standard deviation) for different warming rates. Residual variability is used from Community Earth System Model 2 simulations for annual five-day maxima over the Pacific north-west. Credit: Amended from Fischer et al (2025).

We therefore conclude that the high frequency of record-shattering hot extremes in recent years is controlled by the very high rate of warming caused by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.

This tight coupling of record counts to the rate or speed of warming implies that there will be early benefits of slowing down global warming.

In our research, we look at how the probability of hot and cold records changes under different emissions reduction scenarios. To do this, we analysed the occurrence of record hot and cold events in climate model projections in the CMIP6 archive.

The figure below shows how stabilising temperatures by achieving net-zero carbon emissions (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) will lead to a rapid decline of records, even if temperatures remain higher than in the historical period.

(It is worth noting that, while the number of records will decline under this lower-emissions scenario, the number of heatwaves would remain higher than today.)

Under intermediate (SSP2-4.5), high (SSP3-7.0) and very high emission (SSP5-8.5) scenarios, the number of records would continue to increase to levels much higher than today.

The record ratio is calculated as the probability of all-time record daily hot or cold temperatures across global land regions, relative to the theoretically expected occurrence in a stationary climate. The black line represents the historical record. Credit: Fischer et al. (2025)

Rainfall records

We would also expect rainfall records to become progressively rarer in a stationary climate.

However, we find that record-breaking heavy precipitation occurred about 40% more often in 2015-24 than would be expected in a stationary climate. Many record-shattering heavy rainfall extremes occurred in the mid-latitudes and led to flooding which had large impacts.

(Calculating the frequency of records is more challenging for rainfall than for temperature, given small-scale variations and uncertainties in rainfall observations.)

The greater number of record-breaking rainfall events is due to an increase in precipitation intensity over most land regions as the atmosphere warms, as well as larger variations of rainfall intensity on a day-to-day, season-to-season and year-to-year basis .

We also find that the margin by which previous rainfall records are broken tends to become larger and larger in time. This is due to the “non-symmetric” distribution of rainfall – where there are many days with little precipitation, less with heavy precipitation and very few with very extreme precipitation.

It is therefore not surprising to see record-shattering precipitation events exceeding previous records by 20-50% in intensity, even if overall precipitation intensity increases by roughly 7% per degree of warming.

Preparing for the future

Efforts to adapt to climate change are typically informed by the worst events observed in recent generations.

This means that society is often underprepared for record-shattering events – which by their very definition are of unprecedented intensity.

Qualitative and quantitative storyline methods can offer insight into the many record-breaking events to come into the future – and, thus, help society prepare for escalating climate impacts.

These methods combine information from historical and paleoarchives, long measurement series, targeted climate model experiments, statistical and machine learning methods and weather forecasting systems.

Ultimately, these methods can improve society’s preparedness to climate change, so that the next record-shattering extreme does not come as a surprise.","The article examines how the frequency of climate records, such as daily high temperatures, rainfall, and cold events, have been exceeding natural expectations. The key insights are that the pace of global warming controls the occurrence of these extreme events and that records are expected to become less rare over time, even if temperatures continue to rise. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the changing frequency of climate extremes.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-how-climate-change-is-fuelling-record-breaking-extreme-weather/

MSS Releases Inaugural Annual Climate Assessment Report For Singapore And Launches Mobile Weather APP ‘WEATHER@SG’,"2015 was the warmest and second driest year on record

Singapore, 22 March 2016 –The Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) has today released its inaugural Annual Climate Assessment Report and launched its weather mobile application, ‘Weather@SG’, both in conjunction with World Meteorological Day (WMD) 2016. WMD is annually observed around the world on 23 March, and this year, the theme for WMD 2016 is “Hotter, drier, wetter. Face the Future” to illustrate the reality of climate change and to highlight that, without urgent action to cut emissions, the trend of increasing temperatures and the frequency and intensity of extreme events will accelerate.

Annual Climate Assessment Report 2015

2 MSS’ Annual Climate Assessment Report will be an annual publication available online at MSS’ website at https://www.weather.gov.sg, and serves to provide relevant and useful weather and climate information, and a perspective of the current climate of Singapore with that of historical records. The 2015 report provides details of the climate trends for Singapore, including climatic features and notable weather events that affected Singapore in 2015.

2015 as warmest year on record

3 When the world experienced its hottest year in 2015[1], Singapore similarly recorded one of its warmest years in history. 2015, together with 1997 and 1998 saw annual mean temperatures of 28.3 degrees Celsius, exceeding the climatological average by 0.8 degrees Celsius. In fact, eight of Singapore’s 10 warmest years have occurred in the current 21st century. In years to come, there are indications of the daily mean temperatures increasing further, and the climatologically drier periods becoming drier and the wetter periods becoming wetter. Refer to Annex A for the table of 10 warmest years based on records at MSS’ climate station.

4 In 2015 Singapore also saw warmer than normal monthly temperatures for all months except February. New monthly records were set last year with the warmest months being July, October, November and December, the highest since Singapore’s temperature records began in 1929.

5 The warming trend in Singapore has been observed over a number of decades. The average rise of 0.25 degrees Celcius per decade from 1948 to 2015 is higher than the global warming rate of 0.12 degrees Celcius for a similar period (1951 – 2012). This trend is observed to be accompanied by an increase in the number of warm days (days with temperature above 34.1 degrees Celcius) and warm nights in Singapore, occurring against a background of year-to-year climate variability, mostly associated with El Niño and La Niña events.

2015 as second driest year on record

6 With only 1,266.8mm of rainfall recorded last year, 2015 was the second driest year, with 1997 being the driest year. The drier weather in the second half of 2015 was exacerbated by the prevailing El Niño, which in turn contributed to one of the longest and most severe transboundary haze events experienced in Singapore. Refer to Annex A for the table of 10 driest years based on records at MSS’ climate station.

El Niño Outlook for 2016

7 The prevailing strong El Niño, which developed in mid-2015 and peaked in December 2015, is gradually weakening, and is forecast to weaken further as it transitions to neutral (neither El Niño nor La Niña) conditions around mid-2016. Latest projections from major international climate centres indicate that there is equal likelihood for neutral conditions to perisist or for La Niña to develop in the later part of 2016. Over the next one or two months, warmer conditions can still be expected with the mean monthly temperatures likely to be significantly higher than their respective long-term averages. More warm days with daily maximum temperatures between 33 and 35 degrees Celsius can be expected.

Weather@SG Weather Application

8 With indications that hotter, drier and wetter weather conditions could become more frequent in Singapore, timely weather information will become increasingly important. To facilitate a convenient means to check Singapore’s official weather forecasts and observations wherever you are, MSS has also launched its free weather mobile application, ‘Weather@SG’ today. The ‘Weather@SG’ mobile application can be downloaded from both the Apple App Store and the Android Play Store.

9 The ‘Weather@SG’ mobile application provides users with access to the latest national forecasts, observations as well as warnings and advisories. Through the ‘Weather@SG’ application, mobile phone users can receive push notifications of heavy rain warnings and other hazards. The weather mobile application has features to detect a user’s location and automatically display the 2-hour Nowcast and the current weather conditions such as temperature, rain amount and wind information. In addition, graphical temperature and rainfall trends for the past 12 hours are available. Users will also be able to view the rain areas over the island and up to 240km away. Please refer to Annex B for screenshots of the ‘Weather@SG’ mobile application.

MSS Releases Review Of 2017’s Weather And Climate For Singapore,"2017 is the warmest year on record not influenced by an El Niño event

Singapore, 11 January 2018 – A review of the weather and climate in 2017 was released today by the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS). It summarises the main climatic features and notable weather events that affected Singapore and is a prelude to the comprehensive Annual Climate Assessment Report which will be released on World Meteorological Day in March 2018. The review is available on MSS’ website at https://www.weather.gov.sg (refer to Annex A for an infographic on Singapore’s Climate in 2017).

2 2017 is the warmest year on record that was not influenced by an El Niño event, indicative of the long-term temperature rise that Singapore has been experiencing due to factors such as global warming and urbanisation. After two successive record warm years in 2015 and 2016, the 2017 mean annual temperature at 27.7°C has returned to a level closer to the 1981-2010 long-term average. This is still 0.2°C warmer than the long-term average and the joint 12th warmest year on record since Singapore temperature records started in 1929.

Neutral El Niño Southern Oscillation

3 The El Niño Southern Oscillation[1] (ENSO), a naturally occurring phenomena and a major contributor to year-to-year rainfall and temperature variations over Singapore and Southeast Asia, was neutral throughout 2017 (except in November and December where it reached borderline La Niña values). Given the influence ENSO can have on temperatures, it is not surprising that following 2015’s large El Niño event which contributed to 2015 and 2016 being successive record warm years, no temperature record was broken in 2017.

4 There was a mixture of above and below normal level rainfall for the individual months in 2017, but overall the annual total rainfall was close to normal. This is more likely to be observed during a largely neutral ENSO year. The annual total rainfall of 2,045.6mm recorded was around 6 per cent below the long-term average of 2,165.9mm.

Notable weather events in 2017

5 While 2017 was not an El Niño year, some very warm days were experienced in certain months. October 2017 in particular was warm, with temperatures soaring to above 35°C on some days. Based on the Changi climate station, the hottest day in 2017 was on 18 October 2017 with a high of 34.6°C. The normally cool months of January and December also saw warmer than usual temperatures on some days.

6 Heavy rains from intense thunderstorms caused several incidents of flash floods during the year. There were also occasional incidents of fallen trees and branches due to strong wind gusts from Sumatra squalls, and there was a high frequency of these squalls in 2017. On 18 June 2017, a waterspout associated with thunderstorm clouds was observed off Singapore’s southern coast.

7 Northeast Monsoon rains contributed to a wet February and December in 2017. The 15 rain days recorded in February 2017 was almost twice the long-term average for February, a normally dry month. The year ended on a wet note as the island experienced widespread intermittent rain from a monsoon surge and a nearby vortex in the South China Sea. High rainfall on the last two days of December 2017 raised the month’s total rainfall to 371.2mm (17 per cent above the long-term average), making December the wettest month of 2017.

[1] El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a recurring climate pattern caused by interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean in the tropical Pacific. During El Niño, the central-eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean is warmer than usual, leading to drier and warmer conditions especially during the June to October period over Southeast Asia. During La Niña, the central-eastern equatorial Pacific is cooler than average and the atmosphere over the Southeast Asia region is typically wetter than average. El Niño or La Niña events occur on average once every three to five years.

Second National Climate Change Study Findings Released,"Study results consistent with 5th Assessment Report in projecting global sea-level rise, higher temperatures and more extreme rainfall in the region

Singapore, 15 April 2015 – Meteorological Service Singapore’s (MSS) Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) has released the findings for Phase 1 of the Second National Climate Change Study at a meeting of the Climate Science Experts Network[1]. The outcomes of the new Singapore study are consistent with those of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report (AR5) which projects sea level rises globally, as well as higher temperatures and more extreme rainfall for Singapore and the surrounding region. The details are outlined in paragraphs 5-11 below.

Background of Phase 1 of the 2nd National Climate Change Study

2Under the auspices of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC), the National Environment Agency (NEA) in collaboration with the Met Office Hadley Centre in the United Kingdom commissioned Phase 1 of the 2nd National Climate Change Study, which aimed to provide projections of changes in the main climate variables of interest to Singapore. The key highlight of this report was the use of high resolution climate models to project regional climate and sea level changes with finer spatial detail for the 21st century over the region, centred on Singapore. The study was completed early this year.

3Phase 2 of the study, which started in end 2014, is making use of the projections from Phase 1 to examine the climate change impacts on areas such as water resources and drainage, biodiversity and greenery, network infrastructure and building infrastructure. This in turn will guide Government agencies in their planning and will serve to shape Singapore’s climate change resilience plans. Key findings from Phase 2 can be expected by end 2015.

4Phase 1 of the study makes use of the same global climate model projections that contributed to many of the findings of the physical science component of the AR5 published in 2013 (Please refer to Annex A for details of the IPCC, working groups and the assessment reports). A carefully chosen sub-set of the models for two future trajectories of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere was downscaled to a higher resolution of 12 km for the Southeast Asian region. The first trajectory (RCP8.5)[2] is related to a ‘business as usual’ scenario in which we continue to use fossil fuels with no mitigation and thus results in very high greenhouse gas emissions that continue to increase throughout the 21st century. The second trajectory (RCP4.5) assumes future action to control emissions, which peaks in mid-century and then declines. The results from the downscaled projections with these two scenarios are the basis for the study’s findings[3].

Findings on Temperature

5For the period of 2070 – 2099 (relative to 1980-2009), the study projects that average surface temperatures across Singapore will increase by 1.4°C – 2.7°C under the RCP4.5 greenhouse gas trajectory and by 2.9°C – 4.6°C for RCP8.5.

6The findings imply that the unusually warm temperatures Singapore encounters occasionally could become the norm in the future and that days with ‘record’ temperatures above those experienced historically will become more frequent. Due to the high levels of humidity in Singapore, these projected rises in temperature will lead to increasing thermal discomfort and heat stress for those working outdoors.

7The high levels of temperature increase under the RCP8.5 scenario will be realised only if there is no global mitigation action to reduce greenhouse emissions.

Findings on Rainfall

8The projections from most models show an increasing trend, particularly during the wetter season, in the intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall events over Singapore.

9For seasonal average rainfall, the contrast between the wetter and drier months is projected to become more pronounced, especially for the RCP8.5 trajectory and by the end of the century. The study projects an upward trend in seasonal mean rainfall during the wet season of November to January, as well as greater dryness during months that are already relatively drier in the current climate (February and June to September).

Findings on Sea Level

10For the period of 2070 – 2099 (relative to 1980-2009), the study projects a mean sea level rise of 0.25m – 0.60m under the RCP4.5 greenhouse gas trajectory and 0.35m – 0.76m for RCP8.5. Under the ‘high-emissions’ RCP8.5 greenhouse gas trajectory, the study projects a total rise of 0.45m – 1.02m by the year 2100.

11The study projects no consistent future changes in the amplitude of extreme sea level events, such as as wind driven coastal storm surges and high waves. These events will, however, occur against a backdrop of increased mean sea levels.

Staying Resilient In The Face Of Climate Change

12The effects of climate change operate in the long term, but the Government is taking a proactive approach to address its potential impact. The Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC) was established in 2007 to enhance Whole-of-Government coordination on climate change policies. The Resilience Working Group (RWG), an inter-agency platform under the IMCCC, studies Singapore’s vulnerability to the effects of climate change and recommends long-term plans that ensure the nation’s adaptation to future environmental changes. The findings from this study will provide the basis by which we continually develop long-term infrastructure adaptation plans to appropriately address the effects of climate change on Singapore’s physical environment. The Government has also set aside at least $50 million for climate resilience related studies to support Singapore’s adaptation planning efforts.

Svalbard: Can scientists salvage climate data from rapidly melting glaciers?,"On a speedboat in the Arctic Ocean, a team of scientists are hurtling towards a glacier known as Blomstrandbreen, an 18-km-long river of blue and grey ice.

Blombstrandbreen sits on top of Svalbard, an island located at 79 degrees north in the Arctic Ocean.

The terminus of the glacier directly faces the sea – and, to get close, the boat must navigate car-sized chunks of ice that have recently calved off the glacier.

As the boat slows down, the whirr of its engine is replaced by the sound of these chunks of glacier ice rapidly melting – similar to a chorus of dripping taps.

Accompanying this is a strange cracking and popping sound, resembling popcorn in a microwave.

“That sound is the air bubbles in the ice escaping as it melts,” explains Dorothea Moser, an ice core scientist at the British Antarctic Survey. “The air is probably nearly 200 years old. It’s from the Victorian times.”

The air bubbles trapped within glacial ice tell a story of Earth’s history.

The composition of gases contained within each bubble can help to inform scientists about the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere at the time when the ice was formed.

Researchers study the unique historical records contained within glaciers by drilling and removing ice cores.

However, such information is at risk of being lost as glacial ice rapidly melts because of climate change.

Moser is part of a team of researchers that is racing to investigate the extent to which climate change is affecting records stored within glacial ice – and if there is any way to salvage this information once melting has taken its toll.

To hear more about Moser’s work at the UK’s Arctic Research Station, watch Carbon Brief’s recording of a webinar broadcast live from Ny-Ålesund in 2024.","The article is discussing the sounds glaciers make as they melt, and how scientists are studying the unique sounds and air bubbles trapped in glaciers.

UK spending review 2025: Key climate and energy announcements,"UK chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled the first spending review under the current Labour government, announcing funding for nuclear power, energy efficiency and carbon capture and storage (CCS).

A spending review establishes each ministry’s spending limits and priorities for the rest of the parliamentary term.

The Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) received one of the largest jumps in capital spending, despite energy secretary Ed Miliband reportedly being one of the last to agree to a spending settlement.

Before the final details had been announced, the Times was describing Miliband as one of the “biggest winners” from the process.

High-profile funding announcements in the Treasury’s spending review include £14.2bn for the Sizewell C new nuclear power plant in Suffolk, the first state-backed nuclear power station for decades.

Elsewhere, two new CCS clusters – Acorn and Viking – were allocated funding and railways across the nation were given a boost.

Below, Carbon Brief runs through the key announcements.

Departmental spending

Spending reviews are an opportunity for governments to stake out their priorities by setting the budgets for departments over the rest of this parliament.

Reeves’ spending review has been viewed by experts and media commentators as an opportunity to boost Labour’s flagging popularity and pursue some of its key manifesto commitments, including net-zero.

It covers plans for departmental “resource” spending – including day-to-day running costs – out to 2028-29 and “capital” spending out to 2029-30.

The latter includes injections of funding for infrastructure and public services, such as major clean-energy and transport projects.

In her speech launching the review, Reeves did not specifically mention the terms net-zero or climate change, but stressed the importance of achieving energy security via domestic, low-carbon power. “Clean energy” also featured prominently in the review document itself.

Overall, total departmental budgets are set to grow by 2.3% in real terms across the spending review period.

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) is expected to see a 16% increase in overall departmental spending, reaching £12.6bn in 2028-29.

(This does not include the boost in funding for Sizewell C nuclear plant, which will see a 15.6% increase thanks to a £14.2bn investment over the next five years. See: New nuclear.)

The chart below – taken from the spending review document – shows that while the absolute increase in spending on areas such as health, defence and education is higher, DESNZ is among the most highly prioritised in relative terms.

The review document emphasises that this increase in public money is necessary to mobilise private investment and “secure the UK’s electricity system with homegrown, clean power by 2030”.

Other departments that are also relevant for climate action have not seen the same overall increases in budget.

The Department for Transport (DfT) is set to see its overall departmental spending drop by 0.4%. However, the review notes that capital spending will increase, including more money for local low-carbon transport options and major rail projects.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) budget is also expected to fall overall, but support for “nature-friendly farming” is set to more than double over the review period.

Energy efficiency

Leading up to the spending review, there had been speculation that the government might cut plans to invest £13.2bn on upgrading the nation’s homes under its “warm homes plan”, which had been a manifesto commitment ahead of last year’s election.

Such a move could have cost households more than £1.4bn a year in avoidable energy bills, according to analysis from thinktank the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU).

However, the spending review confirmed the pledged £13.2bn in funding for the scheme, covering spending between 2025-26 and 2029-30.

The government says this will help to cut bills by up to £600 per household through energy efficiency measures, heat pumps, solar panels and batteries. It will also help support tens of thousands of jobs across the country, the spending review adds.

According to innovation agency Nesta, the warm homes funding is roughly double the previous government’s commitment, amounting to a £6.6bn increase in government spending on home upgrades over the current parliament, compared with the previous one.

It will see around one-fifth of the nation’s housing stock upgraded by 2029, although to a varying degree.

Responding to the announcement, trade association Energy UK’s chief executive Dhara Vyas said in a statement:

“It’s also very important that millions of customers will see a direct benefit from today’s announcements. By reaffirming the funding to improve the energy efficiency of millions of homes and supporting the switch to cleaner heating alternatives, customers can expect warmer and more comfortable homes, cleaner air and cheaper bills – showing how the energy transition can improve their daily lives.”

Funding for the warm homes plan in the spending review follows £3.4bn in investment announced for the scheme at the autumn budget in 2024. At the time, Labour had said that this was just the “first step” in investment for decarbonisation and household energy efficiency within the scheme.

However, some highlighted that £5bn of the £13.2bn total is set to come from “financial transactions”, likely to mean loans rather than capital spending.

Further details for the warm homes plan will be confirmed in October, the spending review says.

Beyond energy efficiency, Reeves announced what she called the “biggest boost to investment in social and affordable housing in a generation”, confirming £39bn in funding for a 10-year affordable homes programme.

This will nearly double government spending on affordable housing, according to reporting earlier this week.

Miliband recently announced changes to the “future homes standard” that will mean almost all new homes will have to be built with rooftop solar as a default, high levels of energy efficiency and low-carbon heating, such as heat pumps.

As such, new properties built under the affordable homes programme will largely have to include energy efficiency measures and low-carbon energy technologies.

Energy infrastructure investment

GB Energy

The spending review also confirms that it will allocate £8.3bn in funding for Great British Energy (GB Energy) and the linked GB Energy – Nuclear, another manifesto commitment.

It says this has been achieved by allocating £9.6bn in “additional financial transactions, such as loans and equity investments, to support growth”.

(It explains that “financial transactions” are designed to “allow government to invest alongside the private sector, through equity investments, loans and guarantees”. The document also says that GB Energy will be designated as a “public financial institution”.)

In addition to this top-line confirmation for GB Energy, the spending review also gives it an extra £300m in support for offshore wind supply chains.

This forms part of the “government’s investment in resilient and clean energy security, boosting domestic jobs, mobilising additional private investment and securing manufacturing facilities for critical clean energy supply chains such as floating offshore platforms”, it notes.

The spending review confirms up to £80m for port investment to support floating offshore wind deployment in Port Talbot in Wales, subject to final due diligence.

GB Energy funding follows on from Labour’s manifesto, promising investment into technologies such as floating offshore wind, as well as partnering with local authorities and the private sector to support the deployment of mature technologies.

A piece in the Guardian following the spending review highlights that while GB Energy was getting the £8bn it had been pledged in the manifesto, the company will now “effectively lose £2.5bn” to the allied nuclear company “Great British Energy – Nuclear”.

The article says: “The move has ignited a row between the government’s officials and GB Energy over the need to share funds that were promised to the newly established energy company.” It adds that an industry source told the publication that Great British Nuclear had been renamed to GB Energy – Nuclear, so that Labour could “make the manifesto commitment add up”.

The Financial Times similarly says GB Energy “has been handed the £2.5bn bill” for small nuclear plants, “cutting the amount it has to spend on wind, solar and other technologies”.

New nuclear

Ahead of the spending review, the chancellor announced a £14.2bn investment in the planned Sizewell C new nuclear power plant in Suffolk.

The plant is being jointly developed by the UK government with French state-owned utility firm EDF Energy, which is already building the Hinkley C plant in Somerset.

Each new plant will have a capacity of 3.2 gigawatts (GW), enough to power six million homes. During its construction, Sizewell C will provide 10,000 jobs, including 1,500 apprenticeships, according to the government.

In a statement earlier this week, energy secretary Ed Miliband said new nuclear was needed for energy security, lower bills and to help cut emissions. He said:

“We need new nuclear to deliver a golden age of clean-energy abundance, because that is the only way to protect family finances, take back control of our energy, and tackle the climate crisis.

“This is the government’s clean energy mission in action- investing in lower bills and good jobs for energy security.”

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme following the investment announcement, Miliband stated that China would not be able to invest in the new nuclear plant in Suffolk. He further clarified that, while the majority of the investment would come from the UK government, there will also be private investment announced at a later date.

Sizewell C will be one of the first new nuclear power stations in the UK in decades, with no new nuclear power plants having opened since 1995 and all but one of the existing fleet expected to retire by the early 2030s.

The under-construction plant at Hinkley Point C is also being developed by EDF and is expected to serve as a “blueprint” for Sizewell C.

The Hinkley C plant is being funded via a “contract for difference” (CfD), under which EDF is responsible for the upfront investment costs, but will receive £92.50 per megawatt hour (MWh, 2012 prices) for each unit of electricity generated. (This will drop to £89.50/MWh in 2012 prices as a result of the Sizewell C project going ahead.)

EDF has reportedly accepted that Hinkley C will cost more than £40bn to complete, but has “rejected claims” that the Sizewell C scheme would cost a similar amount.

Sizewell C is due to be funded under the “regulated asset base” (RAB) model and so will not receive a CfD, but the details of this deal are not yet available. The final investment decision on the project is due later this summer, according to reports.

Additionally, the government announced Rolls-Royce has been selected to build small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) following a “rigorous” two-year competition.

Rolls-Royce will partner with Great British Energy – Nuclear as part of the government’s industrial strategy, which will see £2.5bn invested over the spending review period.

The firm is expected to build three SMRs, with the first connecting to the grid “in the mid-2030s”, according to Rolls-Royce.

The spending review also included over £2.5bn for nuclear fusion. This will include support for the design and build of a prototype energy plant in Nottinghamshire.

The document notes that the government is providing a “pathway for privately led advanced nuclear technologies”, although details are not elaborated.

Great British Energy – Nuclear will shortly publish a new framework with the National Wealth Fund for exploring further investment opportunities for viable nuclear projects.

The spending review includes £13.9bn for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, to keep “former nuclear sites and facilities safe and secure as it decommissions sites and manages nuclear waste”.

Back to top

Carbon capture and storage

The UK has already pledged “up to” £21.7bn of funding over 25 years to support five carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, involving “clusters” of connected facilities.

Most of this funding will come from levies on consumers, but the government has also been gradually announcing chunks of public investment to get these initiatives off the ground.

The spending review allocates another £9.4bn of capital spending by 2029. This will partly go towards “maximis[ing] deployment to fill the [CO2] storage capacity” of the first two funded clusters.

At the same time, the government also confirmed its support for the next two clusters – Acorn in north-east Scotland and Viking in the Humber in the spending review. These projects are set to be up and running in the 2030s.

The review states that the government is providing the “development funding to advance [the] delivery” of these clusters, with a final investment decision expected “later this parliament, subject to project readiness and affordability”.

Pathways set out by government advisors at the Climate Change Committee (CCC) suggest CCS is required to meet the UK’s net-zero targets.

However, the government has faced intense scrutiny over its investments in CCS. A report by the influential Public Accounts Committee earlier this year said investing public funds in this relatively undeveloped technology was a “high risk” approach.

Back to top

Transport

The spending review includes a number of commitments for regional transport projects that could help cut UK emissions, including rail upgrades, bus lanes and cycleways.

Overall, the Department for Transport (DfT) settlement will reach total funding of £31.5bn in 2028-29, a slight increase from current levels. This includes support for the HS2 high-speed rail project.

HS2, which had its second phase out to Manchester cancelled under the Conservatives in 2023, will see its funding drop over the spending period.

Meanwhile, capital spending on transport projects around the country is set to experience a 4% real-terms growth rate each year out to 2029-30.

Regional transport projects receiving funding include the TransPennine Route Upgrade between York and Manchester, with £3.5bn, as well as £2.5bn for East-West Rail between Oxford and Cambridge and £300m for rail investment in Wales.

(For comparison, despite the declining funds, HS2 will receive £25.3bn over the period.)

Other relevant investments in the spending review include a commitment to “more than double” city region transport spending per year by 2029-30, by providing a total of £15.6bn for elected mayors across England. The review says this could go towards local transport priorities, including “zero-emission buses, trams and local rail”.

Additionally, there is another £2.3bn allocated for investment in local transport grants to support “bus lanes, cycleways and congestion improvement measures” for areas outside the larger regions with mayors.

The review includes a relatively small sum – £2.6bn – of capital investment that is set aside to “decarbonise transport” as “part of the government’s clean energy mission”.

This is made up of £1.4bn to “support continued uptake” of electric vehicles, in particular vans and heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), as well as £400m for charging infrastructure and £616m for walking and cycling infrastructure.

Some of these funds will also support the production of “sustainable” aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK by extending the government’s advanced fuels fund.

The spending review also includes funding for transport projects that may not help to decarbonise the nation’s transport. Notably, there is £24bn of funding by 2030 to “maintain and improve motorways and local roads across the country”.

Also, while the project is not mentioned in the spending review document itself, Reeves’s speech mentioned “backing Doncaster airport” alongside “investment to connect our cities and our towns”. (The airport is currently closed, but there has been a local political effort to reopen it.)

Other announcements

R&D funding

The government is increasing research and development (R&D) funding to £22.6bn per year by 2029-2030.

This will include funding for the UK’s science base, the spending review says, such as the non-departmental public body UK Research and Innovation and research initiative Horizon Europe.

Part of this funding will go to the government’s new R&D missions accelerator programme. Some £500m of public funds are intended to leverage a further £1.5bn of private investment in innovation that supports the government’s “missions”.

(One of the five key “missions” announced by the Labour government in its manifesto is to “make Britain a clean-energy superpower”.)

Additionally, R&D funding will include up to £750m for a new supercomputer at Edinburgh University, the largest in the UK. This will be used to support a broad range of fields, including climate and weather predictions and research into fusion power.

In a statement, secretary of state for Scotland Ian Murray welcomed the funding for the supercomputer, adding:

“This will see Scotland playing a leading role in creating breakthroughs that have a global benefit – such as new medicines, health advances and climate change solutions.”

Ahead of the publication of the delayed UK industrial strategy, the spending review lists relevant R&D commitments.

It says over £3bn in R&D and capital funding over the next four years will go to advanced manufacturing across the UK, “anchoring the supply chain of zero emission vehicles, batteries and ultra-low and zero-carbon emissions aircraft[s]”.

Clean-energy industries will also receive “significant additional funding”, it adds.

Flood defences and farming funds

As part of the spending review, the government announced investment in climate adaptation and the natural environment to “increase the UK’s resilience to the effects of climate change and protect the ecosystems that underpin the economy and food security”.

This includes £2.7bn in sustainable farming and nature recovery funding until 2028-29, as well as £4.2bn to build and maintain flood defences from 2026-27 to 2028-29.

According to the spending review, farmers will benefit from £2.3bn through the farming and countryside programme and up to £400m from additional nature schemes

There will be increasing support for “nature-friendly farming” through environmental land management schemes, which will grow from £800m in 2023-24 to £2bn by 2028-29. This will be sustained by “rapidly winding down” other subsidy payments.

The spending review states that this will make a “significant contribution” to the Environment Act targets, including improvements to water and air quality and creating spaces for wildlife to support biodiversity.

Funding for both flood defences and farm schemes follows the government stating that it was facing “significant funding pressures” of almost £600m in 2024-25 in the autumn budget.

Writing on LinkedIn, Lydia Collas, head of natural environment at thinktank Green Alliance notes that overall the spending review was a “good outcome”, adding:

“Now we need to see the gov[ernment] take clear and well thought out steps to best allocate that budget so that it supports sustainable and resilient food production that has space for nature.

“A good settlement is a good first step, as it means more farmers will be able to get into schemes in the near future, and there’s space for all three [environmental land management] schemes. But funds are by no means unlimited, and we need good policy to make sure it’s spent fairly and well.”

Foreign aid and climate finance

The government announced in February that it would further cut aid spending to 0.3% of gross national income (GNI) by 2027 in order to fund higher defence spending.

This came just three months after the UK, alongside other developed countries, had committed to raising at least $300bn a year for climate action in developing countries at the COP29 climate summit.

Developed countries have traditionally used their aid budgets to meet such “climate finance” goals.

But observers have noted that scaling up climate finance to meet this new target will be difficult, as nations cut back their overseas spending and the world faces overlapping humanitarian crises.

When announcing the cut earlier this year, prime minister Keir Starmer said that the UK would retain its focus on “tackling climate change” in its aid spending. The government also acknowledged that the decision to cut aid would require “many hard choices”.

The government has a pledge to spend £11.6bn over five years on climate finance in developing countries, which ends in 2025-26. Beyond that, it is expected to announce a new pledge to feed into the $300bn goal.

The spending review does not provide details of precisely what this goal will be, or whether it will be more ambitious as other aid programmes undergo swingeing cuts.

It states that the funding plan “prioritises UK multilateral investment across issues where the international system needs to deliver at scale and to reform”, including the “climate and nature crisis”.

It also says the three departments that provide nearly all UK climate finance – the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, DESNZ and Defra – will “maintain progress” on the nation’s international climate goals.

However, the amounts of aid channelled via all three of these departments will be lower in the coming years than they are now, according to the government’s figures.

Back to top

Response to climate-risks report

In a separate document published alongside the spending review, the government also set out its response to the latest “fiscal risks and sustainability” (FRS) report, published by the Office for Budget in September 2024.

Within this, the government reiterates its intention to “accelerate to net-zero”, including via its target for clean power by 2030.

The response adds that, alongside this, the government recognises that it “must also take action to build resilience and ensure the UK is well-prepared for the changing climate”.

It says that FRS identified flooding and extreme heat as areas that need particular attention, before setting out its spending commitments in these areas.

The response also confirms two important dates for UK climate-policy watchers.

First, the response says the government will, in October 2025, publish its “carbon budget delivery plan”. This will set out the plans and policies the government will put in place in order to meet the first six carbon budgets, covering the years out to 2037.

Second, it says that the government will legislate for the seventh UK “carbon budget” by June 2026. This is a legally binding limit on emissions covering five years from 2038 to 2042. The CCC has recommended an 87% reduction below 1990 levels.

How the spending review has been received

Following the spending review, newspapers and commentators reacted to what Reeves described as her “tough decisions”.

Prime minister Keir Starmer had an opinion piece in the Guardian arguing that the review “marks a new stage in the mission of national renewal, built on the foundations laid last year”. He highlighted examples including new nuclear, clean energy and CCS.

Separately, an editorial in the Guardian highlights “wins” for Ed Miliband’s department, amid Reeves’ “shrewdly tightened belts and loosened seams”.

An editorial in the Independent notes that “funds flowing into green energy, transport, housing, AI, R&D, training and alleviating child poverty…draw important political dividing lines between the government, the Conservatives and Reform UK”.

Analysis in the Guardian similarly concludes that the spending review shows Labour’s plans to “take on the right” over net-zero: “By earmarking billions of pounds for the green economy, Labour is setting itself apart from the Tories and Reform.”

In the Times, an editorial dubs the green light for the Sizewell C nuclear power plant and £15bn for local transport projects “welcome and overdue”. Similarly, a Daily Mail editorial says the government “deserves praise for finally signing off” Sizewell C.

However, Times commentator Alistair Osborne says the Sizewell C project risks being in “meltdown” over cost. Similarly, a comment article by Guardian financial editor Nils Pratley says the project is “needed”, but “critical cost numbers are still missing”. Daily Mail city editor Alex Brummer praises the government’s decision to approve three small nuclear reactors.","The article discusses how the UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves' spending review has allocated funds for nuclear power, energy efficiency, carbon capture, and storage.

Svalbard: How it feels to be a climate scientist in the fastest-warming place on Earth,"What do you research here in Svalbard?

Clarissa: I work on permafrost research. I’m interested in modelling permafrost landscape change under climate change.

Anfisa: I’m helping Clarissa with her research. I’m also working in the field of biogeochemistry, mostly in mainland Norway. I’m hoping to study greenhouse gas emissions in a peatland area that is quite vulnerable to climate change.

What does a day in your life look like when you’re conducting field research?

Clarissa: One has to be very spontaneous here. The weather can change quite quickly and you have to be prepared for all possibilities and take opportunities when you can. We pack everything in the evening, have breakfast at 7.30am and try to be out in the field by 8.30am. Usually we come back after dinner. So we usually have lunch outside and a late dinner. It is just the two of us and we go everywhere by bike or on foot.

Anfisa: It’s only the two of us so we have to be responsible for each other in terms of polar bear protection. Usually, one person will do the job and the other will keep watch for bears. In Svalbard, you have to constantly think about polar bears.

For how long have you carried out research in the Arctic?

Clarissa: I have done research in the Arctic for five years now. It’s always exciting to come back. This is my first time in Ny-Ålesund.

Anfisa: I have done research since 2018. I have mostly worked in the Russian Arctic.

Have you witnessed any climate change impacts in the Arctic that have shocked you or stayed with you?

Clarissa: It is sad to see the velocity that the glaciers are melting. Just hearing them in summer breaking off and calving into the ocean. Knowing that this is a natural process, but also knowing that this is enhanced by us humans. Svalbard is the fastest-warming place in the Arctic. It makes me sad to witness it.

Anfisa: I have been working mostly with ground ice and it’s melting so fast. It’s the same with glaciers, it’s so visible. Every year you can see changes. In Yamal [in Russia], there are greenhouse gas-emitting craters. They look really scary, like a big hole in the ground.

Has working in the Arctic changed your perspective on life?

Clarissa: Yes. It’s a very rough environment. It makes you prioritise differently. It makes you be very present and makes you realise that you should make plans, but life is going to happen and you have to be spontaneous and change plans. You need to be strong and independent, but you’re only going to get so far alone. It’s always a team of people making things possible here.

Anfisa: I think so. In the Arctic, everything depends on you and a small group of people. You need to be honest with everyone and with yourself. Be careful and polite, not only to people but also to nature. If you see a polar bear, you have to be extra polite.

What is one thing you wish people in your country knew about your research, the Arctic or climate change in general?

Clarissa: I think most people know what climate change is and what it would take to act accordingly to prevent the worst from happening, but I think the emotional connection is lacking. I think it is very valuable for people to see how vulnerable and beautiful the Arctic is and how much we should take care of it. But on the other hand, the typical trips for people to experience it are not exactly climate friendly. So I don’t have a solution for that myself. But I guess carrying out outreach through our research and social media can help people relate and eventually create an emotional connection to change behaviour.

Anfisa: In the Arctic, there are Indigenous people who live there. I would love people who do not live in the Arctic and who are not familiar with the culture of these people to become more familiar and listen to them more carefully. Especially when we are talking about Russia. Russia is so big and the Arctic zone is massive. Everyone should be familiar with the conditions Indigenous people live in [in Russia] and how climate change is changing their lives.","Yes, the article mentions that they have seen the impacts of climate change, including melting permafrost and changing wildlife behavior, such as more frequent interactions between scientists and polar bears.  The work focuses on how climate change affects vulnerable areas.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/svalbard-how-it-feels-to-be-a-climate-scientist-in-the-fastest-warming-place-on-earth/
